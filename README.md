# Loan-Default-Prediction-Using-Decision-Tree-Algorithm
A loan default occurs when a borrower takes money from a bank and does not repay the loan. People often default on loans due to various reasons. Borrowers who default on loans not only damage their credit but also risk being sued and having their wages garnished.

*Business Objective: 

For a Lending company, it is very important to know whether a customer who availed a loan will pay back the loan or default on it. Thus before investing their money they rely on Predictive Analytics, to figure out which category of customers have a chance of defaulting on future loans. Based on these data driven strategies, these lending companies are able to make smarter decisions in lending money to the right kind of customers.

Problem Statement:

We have been assigned the task to build a Decision Tree Machine Learning model for an Online Lending firm “Lending Club”, that predicts the probability of a customer to Default on Loan.
